title: Filters and Route Security
---

Diesel makes it easy to manage both public and protected routes using the powerful `setupFilter()` method. With `setupFilter()`, you can define specific routes as publicly accessible while enforcing authentication or custom middleware for protected routes. This approach enables fine-grained control over route security, ensuring sensitive resources are well-guarded.

### How to Use `setupFilter()`

The `setupFilter()` method allows you to selectively secure certain endpoints while keeping others open. With `permitAll()`, you can mark specific routes as public, while `authenticate()` applies one or more middleware functions to remaining routes. This flexibility helps keep user information secure while providing accessible, unauthenticated routes as needed.

### Example Usage

Here’s an example setup using Diesel with JWT-based authentication and additional middleware:

```typescript
import { Diesel } from "diesel-core";
import authJwt from "./middleware/authJwt";
import rateLimiter from "./middleware/rateLimiter";

const app = new Diesel();

// Define routes and apply filters
app
  .setupFilter()
  .routeMatcher("/api/user/register", "/api/user/login", "/test/:id", "/cookie") // Public routes
  .permitAll() // Mark as public, no authentication required
  .authenticate([authJwt, rateLimiter]); // Apply multiple middleware to protected routes

// Public route example (no authentication needed)
app.get("/api/user/register", async (ctx: ContextType) => {
  return ctx.json({ msg: "This is a public route. No authentication needed." });
});

// Protected route example (requires authentication and rate limiting)
app.get("/api/user/profile", async (ctx: ContextType) => {
  const user = xl.getUser();
  return ctx.json({
    msg: "You are authenticated!",
    user,
  });
});
```

### Breakdown of `setupFilter()` Methods

* `routeMatcher(...routes: string[])`: Specifies which routes should be public (unauthenticated). Supports dynamic parameters (e.g., "/api/user/register", "/api/user/login").

```typescript
.routeMatcher("/api/user/register", "/api/user/login", "/test/:id")
```

* `permitAll()`: Marks routes in `routeMatcher()` as publicly accessible, bypassing middleware.

```typescript
.permitAll()
```

* `authenticate(fnc?: middlewareFunc[])`: Defines one or more middleware functions for routes not included in `routeMatcher()`. If no function is provided, Diesel defaults to an "Unauthorized" response.

```typescript
.authenticate([authJwt, rateLimiter])
```

### Use Cases

#### **Public Routes**
Routes like `/api/user/register` and `/api/user/login` are often public to allow user registration and login without prior authentication. These routes can be added to `routeMatcher()` and marked with `permitAll()` for easy access.

#### **Protected Routes**
For routes handling sensitive information (e.g., `/api/user/profile`), apply `authenticate([authJwt, rateLimiter])` to enforce authentication and other security layers. Only users with valid JWTs and within rate limits will be able to access these routes.

### Benefits of Using Filters in Diesel

✅ **No Need for `app.use()` Middleware** – `setupFilter()` streamlines route protection, eliminating redundant middleware declarations for individual routes.

✅ **Flexible Security** – Easily toggle between public and protected routes.

✅ **Centralized Authentication** – Manage route security in one place for cleaner, more maintainable code.

✅ **Scalable Middleware** – Supports multiple middleware functions per route for enhanced security and functionality.

With Diesel’s `setupFilter()`, securing routes becomes efficient, clear, and adaptable, allowing you to manage public and private endpoints seamlessly.
